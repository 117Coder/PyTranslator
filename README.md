# PyTranslator
A small script using mainly Google APIs to recognise english language, translate it into another language (full list of compatible languages in the README), and then outputs it in speech (through a speaker of any sort) in the desired language. It can do this for languages in characters other than UTF-8, Chinese and Japanese characters for example.
